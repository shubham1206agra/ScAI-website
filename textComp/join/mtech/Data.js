                        The MTech in Machine Intelligence & Data Science (MINDS)
                        is a flagship educational programme for the Yardi ScAI at IIT Delhi,
                        and started in July 2022. The MINDS curriculum includes graduate-level
                        courses in core AI technologies like deep learning and data science,
                        application-oriented courses like computer vision and natural language processing,
                        and also fundamental courses on mathematics underlying modern AI technologies.
                        The students who join the MINDS program will have to complete a set of core courses,
                        bridge core courses, program electives, and a project. These courses could be from
                        course buckets such as mathematics, learning, data science, and applications.

                    <h2>Admission process:</h2>
                    <p>The admission process for M.Tech consist of two stages:

                            please refer to the {" "}<a href="/pdf/MSR_MTech_Shortlisting_Criteria_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > previous year shortlisting criteria</a>{" "}. 
                            The criteria may change semester to semester but can give
                            you a broad idea about the expectations. Four Year B.Tech. / B.E. Degree (first class)
                            or any equivalent degree (e.g., B.S. from a foreign university,
                            and M.Sc., MCA, or other Masterâ€™s degrees done as part of a 3+2 model)
                            from any Engineering or Science discipline. A valid GATE score would be
                            needed where such a requirement is not waived, such as students from an
                            IIT with a CGPA exceeding a threshold. Strong interest and background in
                            computational mathematics and programming are preferred.</li>
                            <li>In the second stage, the shortlisted candidates are invited to appear
                            for an written test. The written test has five sections: (a) General Aptitude,
                            (b) Maths and Stats, (c) Data Structure and Algorithm, (d) Machine Learning, and
                            (e) Programming. The syllabus and reference materials for the written exam can be
