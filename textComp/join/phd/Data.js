                        Once shortlisted, ScAI will assess a student’s
                        preparedness for a PhD by a test that will include
                        probability, statistics, optimisation, linear algebra,
                        data structures, basics of AI, ML and data science, and
                        programming skills. These areas are the pre-requisites
                        for being a successful student at ScAI. If selected in
                        the test, an interview will be conducted to assess this
                        further and also fit with current advisors.

                        After being admitted to ScAI, the PhD coursework will
                        include courses in AI, Machine Learning, Data Science,
                        and mathematical foundations. The students may also be
                        asked to take specific courses needed for a student’s
                        thesis. Students who join the Ph.D. program with a
                        master's degree will have to complete a minimum of 6
                        credits, and students who join the Ph.D. program without
                        a master's degree will have to complete 20 credits.
                        These courses could be from course buckets such as
                        mathematics, learning, data science, and applications.
                        If a student has any further queries, please write to{" "}
